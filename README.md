# blackscholes_deeplearning
Can an artificial neural network learn the Black Scholes option pricing formula .... yes, and quite easily.
This problem will be used as a starting point for implementing neural architecture search (NAS). See the following two papers( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01578.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03268.pdf) for an overview.
